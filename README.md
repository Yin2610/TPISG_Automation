# TPISG_Automation
This is an automation project for my CCA (TP International Students Group).

Automation tasks I plan to do are

Triggered by adding a new record of event in AppSheet
- [x]  creating new event folders 
- [x]  copying new event proposals and registration form templates into respective event folders 
- [ ]  creating event date in TPISG calendar activities spreadsheet, TPISG Google Calendar and the event proposal simultaneously

Triggered by manual clicking action on a custom-made button in SpreadSheet
- [x]  adding event helpers and participants from SpreadSheet data into Google Contacts (to easily add into WhatsApp group)
- [ ]  generating data visualization charts after events to add in the after-action report
- [ ]  updating TPISG database with records of event helpers and participants
