# TPISG_Automation
This is an automation project for my CCA (TP International Students Group).

Automation tasks I plan to do are
- [x]  creating new event folders
- [x]  copying new event proposals and registration form templates into respective event folders
- [ ]  creating event date in TPISG calendar activities spreadsheet, TPISG Google Calendar and the event proposal simultaneously
- [x]  adding event helpers and participants into Google Contacts (easier add into WhatsApp)
- [ ]  generating data visualization charts after events to add in the after-action report
- [ ]  updating TPISG database with records of event helpers and participants
